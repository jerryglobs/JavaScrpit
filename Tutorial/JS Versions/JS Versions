JavaScript / ECMAScript
JavaScript was developed for Netscape. Netscape 2 was the first browser to run JavaScript.

After Netscape the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser.

The latest JavaScript version was 1.8.5. (Identical to ECMAScript 5).

ECMAScript was developed by ECMA International after the organization adopted JavaScript.

The first edition of ECMAScript was released in 1997.
